# GoGoTrade TODO List

## High Priority Tasks

### AI/ML Implementation - Replace Rule-Based System
**Status:** Pending  
**Priority:** High  
**Description:** Current `ai_trading.py` uses traditional technical analysis (RSI, MACD, moving averages) with hard-coded rules instead of actual machine learning. Need to implement real AI/ML models.

**Options to Consider:**
1. **Deep Learning Approach**
   - LSTM/GRU neural networks for time series prediction
   - Feature engineering with technical indicators
   - Multi-timeframe analysis

2. **Classical ML Approach**
   - Random Forest for feature-based classification
   - XGBoost/LightGBM for ensemble learning
   - SVM for pattern recognition

3. **Hybrid Approach**
   - Combine technical analysis with ML models
   - Use indicators as features for ML training
   - Ensemble methods for better predictions

4. **Complete ML Pipeline**
   - Data preprocessing and feature engineering
   - Model training and validation
   - Real-time prediction API
   - Sentiment analysis integration
   - Risk management with ML-based position sizing

**Files to Modify:**
- `backend/app/services/ai_trading.py` - Replace with real ML implementation
- `backend/requirements.txt` - Add ML dependencies (scikit-learn, tensorflow, pytorch)
- Create new ML model files and training pipelines

**Dependencies Needed:**
- TensorFlow/PyTorch for deep learning
- scikit-learn for classical ML
- pandas/numpy for data processing
- yfinance/alpha_vantage for market data
