### Chart Feature Requirements

```javascript
// Example Plotly.js candlestick implementation
const chartData = [{
  type: 'candlestick',
  xaxis: 'x',
  yaxis: 'y',
  x: timestamps,
  open: openPrices,
  high: highPrices,
  low: lowPrices,
  close: closePrices,
  increasing: {line: {color: 'green'}},
  decreasing: {line: {color: 'red'}}
}];

const layout = {
  title: 'Live Stock Chart',
  xaxis: { rangeslider: { visible: false } },
  yaxis: { title: 'Price' }
