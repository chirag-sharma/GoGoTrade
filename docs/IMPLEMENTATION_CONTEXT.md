# Implementation Context & Development History

## Project Overview
**Project Name**: GoGoTrade - AI-Powered Indian Stock Trading Platform  
**Start Date**: August 25, 2025  
**Objective**: Create a tool that leverages AI to read candle charts, analyze trade patterns, and implement various trading strategies for Indian stock markets (NSE/BSE)

## Development History & Context

### Initial Strategy Analysis Phase

**User Request**: Create an AI-powered trading tool for Indian markets that can read candlestick charts and implement trading strategies.

**Strategy Documents Analyzed**:
1. **clStrategy.txt** - Comprehensive 8-phase strategy with Foundation & Architecture approach
2. **clStrategy2.txt** - Enhanced strategy with regulatory compliance and SEBI requirements
3. **gptStrategy.txt** - Practical 8-10 week implementation plan with India-specific focus
4. **gptStrategy2.txt** - Combined "zero-to-live" plan with surgical refinements

### Strategy Assessment & Decision

**Analysis Criteria**:
- Strategic Focus & Market Understanding
- Technical Architecture Quality
- AI Implementation Approach
- Risk Management & Compliance
- Implementation Timeline & Practicality
- Technology Stack & Tools

**Final Recommendation**: Hybrid approach combining **GPT Strategy 2** (as foundation) + **CL Strategy 2** elements

**Key Reasons for Selection**:
1. **Superior regulatory compliance** - Deep understanding of SEBI's 2024-25 requirements
2. **Production-ready architecture** - TimescaleDB, Redis, FastAPI, TradingView Lightweight Charts
3. **Realistic 8-10 week timeline** vs 6-12 months for alternatives
4. **Comprehensive risk management** - Circuit breakers, position sizing, audit trails
5. **AI-powered intelligence** - Clear progression from assistive AI to advanced ensemble strategies

### Technical Architecture Decisions

#### Backend Stack
- **Framework**: Python/FastAPI (chosen for speed and modern async capabilities)
- **Database**: TimescaleDB (time-series optimized for OHLCV data) + Redis (real-time caching)
- **Data Source**: Zerodha Kite Connect WebSocket streaming (best documentation and support)
- **Analytics**: TA-Lib (industry standard), VectorBT (fast backtesting), Backtrader (event-driven)

#### Frontend Stack  
- **Framework**: React/TypeScript (type safety and modern development)
- **Charts**: TradingView Lightweight Charts (professional trading interface)
- **State Management**: Redux Toolkit (predictable state management)
- **UI Library**: Material-UI (consistent design system)

#### Infrastructure
- **Containerization**: Docker + Docker Compose (consistent deployment)
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions (automated testing and deployment)
- **Monitoring**: Grafana + Prometheus (system health and performance)
- **Alerts**: Slack/Discord integration (real-time notifications)

### Regulatory & Compliance Framework

**SEBI Requirements (2024-25)**:
- Algorithmic order tagging mandatory
- Track & trace capabilities for all trades
- Audit trails for regulatory review
- Kill-switch mechanisms for emergency stops

**Risk Management Controls**:
- Position sizing based on ATR/volatility
- Daily loss limits (5% of capital)
- Circuit breakers at multiple levels
- Order throttling and cooldown periods

### AI Implementation Strategy

**Phase A - Assistive AI**:
- Plain-English signal explanations ("Bullish engulfing at 20-EMA reclaim")
- Auto-annotate charts with patterns and indicator states
- Market regime summarization

**Phase B - Pattern Recognition**:
- TA-Lib candlestick patterns with probability scoring
- CNN/ViT on chart images for complex patterns (advisory only)
- Historical pattern performance analysis

**Phase C - Ensemble Strategy**:
- Multi-strategy allocation based on market regime
- Bandit algorithms for strategy selection
- Dynamic risk adjustment based on performance

### Charting Solution Considerations

**Initial Challenge**: TradingView widgets accessibility issues for NSE tickers
**Temporary Consideration**: Alternative charting solutions (Plotly.js, D3.js, Chart.js)
**Final Decision**: TradingView Lightweight Charts (as per original finalized strategy)

**Rationale for TradingView Lightweight Charts**:
- Professional trading interface with built-in financial chart types
- Real-time updates with excellent performance
- Extensive customization and technical indicator support
- Strong React integration and community support

- Limited live trading with single liquid instrument
- Real-time performance analysis and optimization
- Documentation and lessons learned

### Project Structure Rules

**Established Guidelines** (August 25, 2025):
1. **All tests in `tests/` directory** - Centralized testing structure
2. **All docs in `docs/` directory** - Only README.md in root, rest in docs/
3. **Implementation context documentation** - Single source of truth for development history
